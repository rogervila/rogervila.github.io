  <p>As a Senior Backend Developer with over 12 years of experience, I have demonstrated expertise in building robust and scalable backend systems for a variety of web applications. My expertise lies in developing RESTful APIs, designing databases, and integrating third-party services and libraries.</p>
  <p>Throughout my career, I have focused on high-performance, secure, and maintainable application development, working within Agile teams and collaborative environments to deliver reliable solutions.</p>
  <p>My technical skill set includes proficiency in PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony, alongside experience with relational databases like MySQL and Postgres. I also work with Docker for containerization and JavaScript libraries such as React, Vue and Alpine.js for full-stack integration.</p>
  <p>In addition to my professional work, I have recently been exploring AI development through personal side projects. These projects involve building AI tools, chatbots, and applications powered by large language models (LLMs) using Python, LangChain, and related frameworks. This hands‑on exploration has allowed me to deepen my understanding of modern AI workflows and integration strategies.</p>
  <p>As a proactive problem-solver with excellent communication skills, I am committed to delivering high-quality work and continually adapting to emerging technologies that drive innovation and business impact.</p>
