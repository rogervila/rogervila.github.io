# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Roger

I am a Full Stack developer, and I love Open Source and the value that it provides to the community.

You may find some thoughts I wrote about [the value that Open Source brings to my job as a developer](https://rogervila.medium.com/the-value-that-open-source-provides-to-my-job-298ea0a2d185).

ðŸ“¦  These are some of the projects I have created:

- **[Array Diff Multidimensional](https://github.com/rogervila/array-diff-multidimensional)**: Compare the difference between two multidimensional arrays in PHP.
- **[PHP SonarQube Scanner](https://github.com/rogervila/php-sonarqube-scanner)**: Run SonarQube Scanner with composer.
- **[Laravel Email Failer](https://github.com/rogervila/laravel-email-failer)**: Trigger email failures to assert what happens on your Laravel Application when an email fails to send.

Check my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/rogervila) to see more repositories or drop me a message.
