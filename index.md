My expertise lies in developing RESTful APIs, and database design, as well as integrating third-party services and libraries.

Throughout my career, I have gained experience in building high-performance applications with an emphasis on security and maintainability. I have experience with software development methodologies like Agile and have worked extensively in a collaborative team environment.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony, as well as experience with relational databases like MySQL, and Postgres. Additionally, I have experience with Docker and JavaScript libraries like React, and Vue.

As a proactive problem-solver with excellent communication skills, I am committed to delivering high-quality work and ensuring project success. I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments and am passionate about staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and industry trends.
