# 👋 Hi, I'm Roger

I have worked for almost 10 years as a software developer. Currently, I work as a Senior Software Analyst at K-LAGAN, where I lead a team of four developers, building strategic solutions that are helping business to achieve new goals from different technical perspectives (DevOps, Web, Big Data and RPA).

I am deeply passionate about finding technical challenges that allows business to discover new value that helps to grow up.

Previously, I worked as a freelancer on different start-ups placed in Barcelona, developing specific projects, mostly web based, for third-party companies like Coca-cola, HP and GFT among others.

Competencies: PHP (I work with Laravel mainly), JS (Vue and React), Python, DevOPS tools (Docker + Swarm, Jenkins) and Databases (SQL, NoSQL and Graph, mainly Neo4J)

Check my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/rogervila) to see more repositories or drop me a message.
